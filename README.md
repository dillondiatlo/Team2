| energy            | Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. | number [float]  | 0 - 1      | 0.842                                                   |

| instrumentalness | Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.   | number [float]  | 0 - 1      | 0.00686                                                 |
| key               | The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation.

| liveness          | Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.                                                                                                              | number [float]  | 0 - 1      | 0.0866                                                  |
| loudness          | The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Values typically range between -60 and 0 dB.                                                                                                                         | number [float]  | -60 - 0 dB | -5.883                                                  |
